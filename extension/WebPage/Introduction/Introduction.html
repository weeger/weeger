  Hi,<br>
  I'm a french web developer living in Lille.<br><br>
  Few years ago I've decided to create my own javascript library. It tries to
  fill the gap between rich graphical interfaces, content management and web
  semantic, by using HTML5 technologies.
  On the other hand, it offers supports advanced pages transition with no
  browser reloads, lazy loading of mixed types components, dependencies, and
  others interactive stuffs like light 3d methods, states events, plugins and so
  on...<br><br>
  I work actually as an independent developer, I'm interested by learning
  humanities, exploring creativity, and contributing to alternative social
  solutions.
